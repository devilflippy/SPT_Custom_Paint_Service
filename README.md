# SPT_Custom_Paint_Service

This mod is designed for player who play "hardcore like" tarkov and whant to disable customs traders and/or currency trades.

It's an attempt to simulate a Painting service. So you can transform a regular item into a retextured one. Why I didn't said "paint" ? because you will create a new Item, it mean, if you want to change your regular M4 black with 76/94 durability, into a FDE one, you will have a 100/100 durability M4 FDE.
It will be the same for all other items with durability stat.

So basicaly, the real mod is MoreHideoutCrafts by papershredder432 (thanks for his awesome work). https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/999-morehideoutcrafts/.

Then you need one of these retexture mods (or all if you want)
